This system will be a web application that has all the functionality of the existing desktop application with online capabilities and the ability for different users. This system is intended for all participants in a research group. This system will be used to actively store experimental data for a research lab. Project Glossary Attempt An attempt is one data entry recorded from the procedure and assigned to an experiment. Common Attribute - A common attribute is a data column that all subjects have initially. It is pre-defined by the researcher\u2019s data files that the robots create. Custom Attribute - A custom attribute is a user defined data column that does not already exist in the researcher's data files created by the robots. Experiment - An experiment is the collection of subjects and the attempts they have done for a scientific procedure. An example is \u201cSpinal Damage Recovery Experiment (SDRE).\u201d Researcher - A researcher manages the experiments and subjects. They can upload data, add custom attributes, query data, and export their results to an external CSV file. Result - A result is the returned attempts from a search query on some experiments. Results can be exported as an external CSV file. Subject - A subject is an animal used as part of an experiment. Each subject will have a unique ID. Storyboarding This is a storyboard describing user flow, the numbers correspond with something. Use Cases or User Stories User stories can be found under the requirements section here.

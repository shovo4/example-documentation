## Low-Fidelity User interface

At this stage, itâ€™s important to show the overall look and feel of your app, as well as the high-level user-interaction design. Low-fidelity wireframes are usually black and white  Looking at the wireframes, anyone should be able to get an idea of what will be developed.
